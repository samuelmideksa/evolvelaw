          <h3 class="text-primary">Divorce</h3>
          <p>
            Regardless of the reason for divorce, this is likely an emotional and stressful time. In Canada, there are three legal grounds for divorce though two are very rarely used:
            <br>
            <span class="text-primary">Separation</span> <br>
            The most common ground for divorce is separation is when a couple has been living separately and apart for a minimum of one year. Spouses or partners don’t have to be in separate homes; separate bedrooms, meal times, and living spaces may be considered ‘living apart’ as well.
            <br>
            <span class="text-primary">Adultery</span> <br>
            This is when one spouse has engaged in an affair. Suspicion alone is not enough for a judge to grant a divorce and evidence of infidelity will be required. Because of the evidence required, this ground often results in increased costs and delays.
            <br>
            <span class="text-primary">Cruelty</span> <br>
            Emotional or physical cruelty indicates a situation where living with the other spouse is intolerable. Evidence of
            cruelty is required for court proceedings and may be hard to acquire. Unless the cruelty has escalated to include
            medical or police reports, this ground often results in increased costs and delays.
            <br>
            This ground differs from provisions recently introduced under the Divorce Act respecting domestic violence. If you
            require more information regarding domestic abuse, please speak with one of our lawyers.
            <br>
            Whatever your reasons are for pursuing divorce, Evolve Family Law is here to support you and strive for an expeditious resolution.

          <p>
            When relationships end, it is not uncommon for the separation to cause financial stress on one of the two parties
            involved. When this occurs, the court can remediate the situation with different forms of financial support:
            <br>
            <span class="text-primary">Spousal Support</span> <br>
            The intent of spousal support (alimony) is to ensure the individual who becomes financially disadvantaged in the
            separation can maintain a similar quality of life to which they have become accustomed.
            <br><br>Several factors are considered when determining spousal support, such as sacrifices made during the relationship (e.g.
            did one spouse forego education to focus on raising children?), and the receiving party is expected to make reasonable
            efforts to become financially independent in the following years.
            <br>
            <span class="text-primary">Child Support</span> <br>
            It is a parent’s responsibility to provide for their children and the intent of child support is to ensure children have opportunities similar to what they would have experienced had their parents’ not divorced. Child support payments vary based on several factors, such as custody agreements and parental income.
            <br><br>
            Child support payments typically continue until the child is 18 years of age and may continue past this point if the
            child is attending school or is unable to provide for themselves due to a disability.
            <br>
            <a href="#">Child Support Calculator</a>
            <br><br>
            Child and spousal support may be eligible to renegotiate as income, custody, and living situations change. When these conversations arise, we are ready to help you navigate them.

          <p>
            When distributing property in a divorce, the first step is to determine which assets are considered family assets,
            business assets, or individual assets. While this is sometimes straightforward, legal representation is often needed to
            reach an agreement over which assets are considered to be family versus personal.
            <br><br>
            Other professionals, such as appraisers and realtors, can also become involved in this process when necessary. There may
            also be a period of extensive investigation if one party suspects there to be undisclosed assets.

            <span class="text-primary">Interspousal Agreements</span> <br>
            Without an interspousal agreement, property and assets are subject to The Family Property Act during a divorce. For
            those who want special consideration in the event of a death or separation, an interspousal agreement (e.g. prenuptial
            agreement, cohabitation agreement) is essential to protecting their interests.
            <br><br>
            These agreements are commonly used to protect the inheritance of children from a previous marriage, the interests of a
            business partner, or any other allocation of assets that does not follow The Family Property Act.
