          <h3 class="text-primary">Divorce</h3>
          <p>
            Regardless of the reason for divorce, this is likely an emotional and stressful time. In Canada, there are three legal
            grounds for divorce though two are very rarely used:
            <br>
            <span class="text-primary">Separation</span> <br>
            The most common ground for divorce is separation is when a couple has been living separately and apart for a minimum of
            one year. Spouses or partners don’t have to be in separate homes; separate bedrooms, meal times, and living spaces may
            be considered ‘living apart’ as well.
            <br>
            <span class="text-primary">Adultery</span> <br>
            This is when one spouse has engaged in an affair. Suspicion alone is not enough for a judge to grant a divorce and
            evidence of infidelity will be required. Because of the evidence required, this ground often results in increased costs
            and delays.
            <br>
            <span class="text-primary">Cruelty</span> <br>
            Emotional or physical cruelty indicates a situation where living with the other spouse is intolerable. Evidence of
            cruelty is required for court proceedings and may be hard to acquire. Unless the cruelty has escalated to include
            medical or police reports, this ground often results in increased costs and delays.
            <br>
            This ground differs from provisions recently introduced under the Divorce Act respecting domestic violence. If you
            require more information regarding domestic abuse, please speak with one of our lawyers.
            <br>
            Whatever your reasons are for pursuing divorce, Evolve Family Law is here to support you and strive for an expeditious
            resolution.
