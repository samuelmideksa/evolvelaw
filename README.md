                "Beau and his team were efficient, diligent and very pleasant to deal with. It was was very easy to communicate with
                anybody from the practice - just a simple email away and always a prompt response. They offered me wonderful support
                when I needed it most. I would recommend them to anybody looking for a family law practice."

                "All questions were always answered thoroughly, always keeping me in the loop. I felt comfortable with everything we
                did
                and was never left in the dark or confused with how or why things were the way they were. I was always responded to in
                a
                timely manner with my many questions and concerns. The outcome was exactly what I hoped for and what they prepared me
                for. Thanks again!"

                "Everyone I have worked with in the office has been fantastic. They have all been very helpful and quick to answer any
                questions and give guidance. I appreciate the teamwork model. I feel like everyone there has my back and is looking
                out
                for my best interests."

                "I like the model of flat rate service. I know what I am getting for my money and am not surprised at the end. Beau is
                a
                very personable lawyer and tries very hard to get immediate results with keeping the best interest of those most
                affected ( the children) by the divorce in mind."

                "Beau Atkins was amazing to deal with. He was always upfront with costs. Gave me tips on how to keep my costs down and
                told me the things I needed to hear when I was being unreasonable or had unachievable expectations. All of the staff
                within the office have been helpful, pleasant to deal with, happy and positive. This firm helped the light shine
                bright
                in a dark time. So thankful to have had them backing me in a hard time."
